# Advertising-Machine-Learning
Predict the increase or decrease in sales based on mode of advertisement using Linear Regression.

## Dataset :-
Dataset contains amount of advertisement done through varies modes of advertisement and corresponding increase in sales. It contains 200 entries.

## How it works :-
- Import all the used libraries.
- Dataframe is created from dataset using pandas.
- It is then properly edited so that it can be used for training of model.
- Dataframe is divided into training and testing dataframe.
- Model is trained using Linear Regression function present in scikit-learn library.
- Model is tested and accuracy calculated using mean squared function.
- Accuracy at present is 1.928.

## How to Use :-
- Install Jupyter notebook and clone and download the code in the same directory in which Jupyter notebook is installed.
- Open the Notebook and open the code and run it completely.
- Then create array of amount of advertisement done through TV, Radio and Newspaper in same order.
- Predict the output sales value using Linear Regression.

## Future Advancements :-
- To increase accuracy because when the input is 1D array there is chance of increase in error.
- To use a better algorithm so that input can be a 1D array.
